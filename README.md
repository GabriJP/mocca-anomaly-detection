# MOCCA: Multi-Layer One-Class Classification for Anomaly Detection

This repository contains the code relative to the paper "[MOCCA: Multi-Layer One-Class Classification for Anomaly Detection](https://...)" by Fabio Valerio Massoli (ISTI - CNR), Fabrizio Falchi (ISTI - CNR), Alperen Kantarci (), Åžeymanur Akti (), Hazim Kemal Ekenel (), Giuseppe Amato (ISTI - CNR).

It reports a new technique to detect anomalies...
